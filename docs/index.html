            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                WebAssembly (Wasm) has evolved far beyond its initial conception as a way to run high-performance code in web browsers.
                Today, it represents a pivotal shift in how we think about compilation, portability, and safe execution of code across diverse environments.
                This page explores the WebAssembly ecosystem not just as a runtime target, but as a comprehensive compiler infrastructure that facilitates
                a new era of software development.

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2>The Universal Compilation Target</h2>
            <p>
                At its core, WebAssembly provides a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
                This design allows it to serve as a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and many others.
                Unlike previous attempts at universal bytecode, Wasm was designed from the ground up to be efficient, safe, and part of the open web platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compilers like LLVM have embraced Wasm, treating it as a first-class citizen. This integration means that the vast ecosystem of tools
                built around LLVM can natively output WebAssembly. For developers, this translates to the ability to bring existing codebases—spanning
                graphics engines, physics libraries, and data processing tools—to the web and beyond without rewriting a single line of logic.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2>Compiler Infrastructure in the Browser</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most fascinating aspects of the Wasm ecosystem is its ability to run compilers <em>within</em> the browser itself.
                Projects like Emscripten and the Rust compiler have been compiled to Wasm, allowing for client-side compilation pipelines.
                This capability unlocks powerful use cases, such as online IDEs (like StackBlitz or Replit) that can build and run code entirely on the user's device,
                eliminating the latency and cost of server-side compilation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, tools like `wasm-pack` and `bindgen` bridge the gap between Wasm modules and JavaScript, automatically generating the glue code
                necessary for seamless interoperability. This tooling ecosystem transforms Wasm from a raw binary format into a practical, accessible infrastructure
                for modern web development.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2>Beyond the Browser: WASI and the Edge</h2>
            <p>
                The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extends the Wasm ecosystem to non-web environments. By defining a standard interface for system calls,
                WASI allows Wasm modules to run on servers, edge devices, and IoT platforms in a secure and sandboxed manner.
                This effectively turns Wasm into a "write once, run anywhere" solution that actually delivers on the promise, providing a lightweight,
                secure containerization alternative to Docker for certain workloads.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "compiler infrastructure" aspect shines here again, as runtimes like Wasmtime and Wasmer provide Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)
                compilation strategies, optimizing Wasm execution for specific hardware targets on the fly.
